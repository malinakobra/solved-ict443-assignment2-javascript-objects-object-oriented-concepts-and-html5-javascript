Assignment 2:

The purpose of this exercise is to test your knowledge of changing objects usingits prototypes and prototypal inheritance. You will be enhancing the Dynamic Tasklist that you have created in Assignment 1 with custom JavaScript object and extendthe functionality of your application by adding methods for tasks and using HTML5local storage functionality. The user interface will also be enhanced usingJavaScript drag and drop, mouse over and css.

Instructions

1) Creating prototypal inheritance: In assignment 1, you have created genericcustom object for task that had a number of attributes (task name, description etc).For this assignment, you will demonstrate your knowledge of protypal inheritance bycreating a top level task object and different types of tasks based on category.For example, you may have a task category of Grocery that will have differentattributes than a task category of Education. However, both types of tasks willneed to inherit some generic attributes and methods from the parent task object.

2) Dynamically change the user interface for task creation: Change the userinterface to allow users to choose the category/type of task to be created anddynamically change the data entry from so that only fields relevant to the typeof tasks being entered are shown to the user. In addition, when the task is beingshown provide visual distinguishing features to different types of tasks beingcreated.

3) Enhance reordering of task by using HTML5 drag-and-drop: In assignment 1,you have allowed users to reorder the tasks without drag and drop. For assignment1, enhance the recording functionally by allowing users to drag and drop tasks andreorder them.

4) Save information into local storage: Provide the user to save the tasks andrelated information to be saved to the HTML5 local storage. Test this by closeyour browser and going to your page again and ensuring that the informationremains in the local storage. Enhance the “Clear tasks” functionality fromassignment 1 to clear the local storage.
